  <li>  How to install packages needed  to run scripts from the book?
    
  Please use the following  instructions<br />
  <br />
  </li>

<ul>
  <li>pckgs &lt;-  c(&quot;plyr&quot;, &quot;reshape&quot;, &quot;RLRsim&quot;,  &quot;WWGbook&quot;, &quot;ellipse&quot;)<br />
    install.packages(pckgs)<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>To install nlmeU package go to  book website at: <br />
  <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~agalecki/Web/software.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~agalecki/Web/software.html</a>  <br />
  <br />
  </li>
  <li>To install lme4.0 package use:
    
  install.packages(&quot;lme4.0&quot;,  repos = &quot;http://R-Forge.R-project.org)<br />
  <br />
  </li>
</ul>

  <li> How to obtain list of scripts  available in nlmeU package?  <br />
    <br />
<ul>
      <li>Please use:<br />
        <br />
library(nlmeU)
        <br />
        runScript()<br />
        <br />
      Note:?? The results of executing scripts are stored  in files: Ch02.Rout, Ch03.Rout and so on.<br />
      <br />
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li> 
    Results of running scripts  listed by runScript() function (see item 2) are different from those included  in the book. Why? <br />
    <br />
    We tested scripts from our  book using R2.15.0 (2012-03-30) under Windows??  7 on x86_64-pc-mingw32/x64 (64-bit) platform. Results matched those  included in the book. We noted that results are slightly different for ??i386-pc-mingw32/i386 (32-bit) platform.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Is pdKronecker class described in  Chapter 17 and Section 20.2 available in nlmeU package?<br />
    <br />
  pdKronecker class is not  available in nlmeU package. It will be available in near future as part of an  additional companion package.<br />
  <br />
  </li>
  <li>What should I do, if I find an  error in one of the functions?<br />
    We tested our functions  under different scenarios, but we consider our package to be under development  and inevitably errors may occur. Please report them to <a href="mailto:agalecki@umich.edu">agalecki@umich.edu</a>.<br />
  We are also interested in  any of your comments on how to improve functions/and or scripts distributed  with the package.</li>
