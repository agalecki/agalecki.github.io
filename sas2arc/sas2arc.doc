General description
-------------------
SAS2ARC.SAS is a SAS macro designed to transform SAS data sets into
datasets in Arc format.  The distribution consists of five files:

sas2arc.doc - this file.
sas2arc.inc - declaration of macros.
sas2arc.sas - an example of macro invocation.
Class.lsp   - an example of output file for use by Arc program.
Classmss.lsp- another example of the output file.


Usage
-----
The file sas2arc.sas provides an example of the use of this macro. The first
50 lines of that file create a SAS dataset called `class' with variables named
name, height, weight, age, and gender.  SAS2Arc can write this dataset onto a
file that can be read by Arc, as follows.  First, the macro must be included
in the SAS session:

%include 'sas2arc.inc';

Next, we create the data file:

%sas2arc(data=class);

Macro variables 
---------------
The sas2arc macro accepts several variables, as follows:

DATA        - REQUIRED name of the input SAS dataset.
FILE        - OPTIONAL output file name for Arc data. If FILE is not 
              specified, the output will be the input SAS data set name 
              with a .lsp extension.
ARCDATA     - OPTIONAL Arc dataset name. If ARCDATA not specified then 
              Arc dataset name is the same as SAS dataset name.
              See the file Class.lsp for an example.
DESCRIPT    - Description about the data set you want to output to the Arc
              dataset file. By default description is:
              Created from SAS dataset <Input SAS dataset>.  This can be any 
              not quoted text string that provides a description of the
              dataset.
MISSING     - specifies missing character in Arc data. By default the missing
              value character is a ?.  The SAS missing value character "."
              CANNOT be used by Arc.

The file sas2arc.sas provides a complete example.

Translating Arc datasets to SAS datasets
----------------------------------------
It is also possible to go the other way, and translate Arc datasets to SAS
datasets.  If you are using version 1.00 of Arc, you will need to download the
most recent version of updates.lsp from www.stat.umn.edu/arc; the changes will
be part of version 1.1 when it is released.

	1.  Start Arc, and load the data file of interest.
	2.  Select the item "Display data" from the dataset menu.
	3.  Check the box for "Save data in an interchange file."  After pushing
OK, select a file name for the interchange file.
   4.  The interchange file will have variable names in the first row, and
values in succeeding rows, with ? used as a missing value character.  Strings
will have "_" substituted for " ", so, for example, Los Angeles becomes
Los_Angeles.  Strings are not quoted.  This file can be used with SAS or most
any other statistical package.
