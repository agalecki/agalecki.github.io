        Dr. Galecki's strong background and education in applied mathematics and medicine has  given him an opportunity to independently pursue advanced methodological  problems in statistics while contributing to interdisciplinary, applied  research in medical and biological sciences. <br />
        <br />
        In his research he is interested in the development and application of modern  statistical methods to research studies, including clinical trials,  epidemiological and genetic studies. His primary interests are driven by  real-life problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; His current research focus is to develop  computational methods for analyzing correlated and over-dispersed data, which  are encountered in many fields of application such as:
       
        <ul>
        <li>population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) studies </li>
        <li>longitudinal studies</li>
        <li>gene mapping in genetics studies </li>
      </ul>
        
        His interdisciplinary collaborative research has involved a wide range of  critical methodological and application contributions at several stages of  research in geriatrics and gerontology, including appropriate specification of  hypotheses tested, study design, data quality monitoring, data analysis and  presentation of the results. For several years he have played a leading role in  the quantitative aspects of the research on a number of large, long-term  NIH-funded projects.<br />
